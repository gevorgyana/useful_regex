# filter stuff - designed to be used with find
alias n=$' awk -F "/" \' {print $2 } \' | sort | uniq -c'

## the following things are meant to work recursively (-r flag)
## always ignore binary files, need only the filenames
# this should work r="int[ \n]*main"
# or this too (?s)int.*main
# perl grep
alias pg=$'grep -Plozr "$r" .'
alias pgi=$'grep -Plozri "$r" .'
# general grep
alias gg=$'grep -Ilr "$r" .'
alias ggi=$'grep -Ilri "$r" .'
# x for extended, e is taken by some other program
alias gx=$'grep -EIlr "$r" .'
alias gxi=$'grep -EIlri "$r" .'
## this is for quick review
alias fl=$' | xargs less'
# use this like this - first u find stuff with greps
# u use $r for the regex expression, follow the 
# directories and see the stuff,
# then u it like this 'pi fl' to see the stuff with less
#### ------ pi fl does not work ------
#### aliases do not take parameters, have to use function
#### like this chre "main", or chre main, or chre "int[ \n]*main"
#### ( need quotes the expression will be expanded otherwise
chre ()
{
    r="$1"
}
